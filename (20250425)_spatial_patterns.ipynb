    "In this practice session, you will learn how to apply basic **spatial analysis** techniques to inspect socioeconomic and environmental patterns in the Netherlands. The major technical step, *Inspecting Spatial Autocorrelation with the Moran's I Index*, will walk you step-by-step through the application of the Moran's I in detecting interesting clustered patterns in your spatial dataset, especially about that referred as the *hotspot* analysis. The data you will be working on is from the Dutch statistical bureau (Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek, CBS), where you can be able to download socioeconomic information about the entire Netherlands with geospatial information attached. All the information is at different geographic levels, for instance, neighborhood, district and city level. Here in this session, we start with the city (gemeente) level for quick demonstration, but please feel free to download more detailed data from CBS.nl. We specifically look at the housing property value (WOZ) as an important indicator of social wellbeing and weathiness at the city level, and try to see how it manifested in space. Again, you are free to use other information contained in the same dataset, and please also refer to the mete data (PDF) for the meaning of the abbreviated data code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this session, we especially rely on the *libpysal* module, which is a very powerful *Python* tool for **spatial analysis**. It is also the backends of a few famous open source software, such as the [*Geoda*](https://geodacenter.github.io/workbook/5a_global_auto/lab5a.html#morans-i).\n",

    "### 2. Spatial weights for spatial contiguity\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "One important step for compute the Moran's I index for this area is to define the weights of the neighboring units for each spatial unit. The weights are normally defined according to the spatial contiguity between the spatial unit and its neighbors. In this case, each spatial unit is a city (gemeente), and its neighbors are simply those cities directly adjacent to it. Without knowing which of the neighbors are more related, the simplest way is to assign equal weights to all the adjcent neighbors. Normally, it is flexible to define spatial units further apart with a decreasing weights along distance, but how weights are decaying according to distance needs further modelling, as we already mentioned by using the variogram in Kriging."
